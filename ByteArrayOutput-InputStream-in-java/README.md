# use the ByteArrayOutputStream and ByteArrayInputStream classes in java core


## Description
In this scenario,
we use the ByteArrayOutputStream and ByteArrayInputStream classes 
to read and write data in bytes. These classes are very useful for
cases where we need to work with binary data temporarily in memory. 
For example, suppose we want to read data from a file or other data source, 
apply changes to it, and then prepare the data for writing elsewhere.

Convert text data to binary and vice versa
Suppose we want to convert a text to bytes,
change it (for example, change all letters to uppercase), 
and then reconstruct it as a new string.
