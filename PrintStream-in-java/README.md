# PrintStream in java

## Description

Suppose you are developing an order management application
for an online store. This program records information about new orders,
order status, and possible errors. For this purpose, PrintStream 
can be used to easily print information to a file or console output. 
PrintStream is a suitable choice for this task due
to the support of print() and println() methods,
as well as the possibility of writing strings and data directly.
