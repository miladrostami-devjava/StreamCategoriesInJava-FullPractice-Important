# SequenceInputStream in java 

## Description :
Suppose you have several text files, each of which contains a piece of data. 
You want to combine these files so that the data is processed continuously and seamlessly.
Using SequenceInputStream, you can read and process these files as a single stream.
In this scenario,
we have three text files named file1.txt, file2.txt and file3.txt.
The goal is to read the contents of these files in sequence 
and display them as a single stream.
