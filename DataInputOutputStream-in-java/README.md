# DataInputStream and DataOutputStream in java

## Description
Suppose you are developing an employee information
management application that needs to store various
information such as name, age, salary and marital
status (single/married) of each employee in a file. 
Instead of using a simple text file that makes working with
data complicated and error-prone, we can use DataOutputStream
and DataInputStream for typed storage and retrieval of data. 
These streams allow you to write and read data 
as types (such as strings, integers, decimals, etc.), 
which improves program accuracy and simplicity.
