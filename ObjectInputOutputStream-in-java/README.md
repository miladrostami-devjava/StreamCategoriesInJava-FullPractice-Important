# ObjectOutputStream  and ObjectInputStream  in java

## Description

Suppose we have a student management system that stores student information 
including their name, student number, and grade point average. 
We want to store this information as Java objects in a file so that
we can later retrieve it and use it for other processing.
For this purpose, we use ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream classes.
